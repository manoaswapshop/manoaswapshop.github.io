# Development goals

We want to provide UHM students and faculty with a simple application that allows them to safely exchange goods.  We plan to implement:

* User accounts for students and faculty
* Administrator accounts for moderators
* Listing page for offered goods and services, sorted by categories
* Listing page for wanted goods and services, sorted by categories
* A search function for users to search for goods
* A listing feature for users to add their goods to the listing page
* Pre-designated meeting locations for student and faculty safety.
