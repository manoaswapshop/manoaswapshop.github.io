# About The Manoa Swap Shop

The Manoa Swap Shop is a Meteor application that provides a safe environment for University of Hawaii at Manoa students and faculty to exchange school related goods and services.

# Development goals

We want to provide UHM students and faculty with a simple application that allows them to safely exchange goods.  We plan to implement:

* User accounts for students and faculty
* Administrator accounts for moderators
* Listing page for offered goods and services, sorted by categories
* Listing page for wanted goods and services, sorted by categories
* A search function for users to search for goods
* A listing feature for users to add their goods to the listing page
* Pre-designated meeting locations for student and faculty safety.

# Page layout and design

Upon arrival at the website, the user will see the following landing page.
